## Basic Go types

bool string int float64

We can initialize a variable outside of a function, we just can't assign a value to it.

## 2 syntax are 100% similar inside a function

```go
var card string = "Ace of Spades"
card := "Ace of Spades"
```

Files in the same package can freely call functions defined in other files.

## 2 type to handle list

### Array and Slice

Array: Fixed length list of thing

Slice: An Array that can grow and shrink

```go
cards := []string{"Ace of Diamonds", newCard()}
// append does not modify the current slide and instead it return a new one
cards = append(cards, "Six of Spades")
// with for loop, every single time that we step through this list cards
// we really throwing away the previous index and the previous card that had been declared
// so thats why we are re-declaring and re-initializing the variables by :=
for i, card := range cards {
    fmt.Println(i, card)
}
```

## Go is not an object oriented programming language

Create a new type inherit old type (slice)

```go
type deck []string
```

A function with a receiver is like a "method" - a function that belongs to an "instance"

```go
func (d deck) print()
```

##### Any variable of type 'deck' now can get access to the print method

"\_" underscore can skip the variable because we dont want to use it

```go
for _, card := range cards {
    fmt.Println(card)
}
```

## Range syntax to select a subset of slice

```go
fruits := []string{"apple", "banana", "grape", "orange"}
slide[startIndexIncluding : upToNotIncluding]
fruits[0:2] // -> ["apple", "banana"]
fruits[:2] // -> ["apple", "banana"]
fruits[2:] // -> ["grape", "orange"]
```

## Type conversion

We do type conversion by listing out the type that we want, a set of parentheses and the value that we have

```go
[]byte("Hi there!")
string(32)
```
