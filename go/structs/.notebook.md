## Zero value

string -> ""
int -> 0
float -> 0
boolean -> false

## Go is pass by value language

That means that whenever you pass a value into a function, go copies that value and then the copy is made available to the code inside the function

## Pointer

Give me the address of the value this variable is pointing at

```go
&variable
danhPointer := &danh
```

Give me the value this memory address is pointing at

```go
*pointer
// This is a type description
// It's means we're working with a pointer to a person
//                      |
func (pointerToPerson *person) updateName(newFirstName string) {
	(*pointerToPerson).firstName = newFirstName
//      |
// This is an operator
// It means we want to manipulate the value the pointer referencing
}
```

## Slide

### When we create a slice, Go will automatically create which two data structures?

An array and a structure that records the length of the slice, the capacity of the slice, and a reference to the underlying array

## Value Types vs Reference Types
